# SciLEx

The SciLEx (Science Literature Exploration) project is a basic python scriptbox made for :
* Request and run API crawler related to a research field
* Managing / Parsing / Deduplicating the collected papers
* Consolidate and Enrich a benchmark  
* Exploring the citations links and expanding a network of sci. papers

I developed ScilEx scripts in the context of a systematic review conducted during my Phd, and introduced in :

## SciLEx Framework

1. Crawl of already existing *surveys* on topic and push it on Zotero
2. Extract *models*, *dataset* from PaperWithCode and push it on Zotero
3. Get DOIs and obtain the citation network
4. Distill it with Zotero API / Annotate it on Zotero and distill your annotations

## ðŸ¤“ How to contribute to SciLEX ? 

- By extending the API integrated to SciLex
- By Improving the metainformation integration
- By extending it to analytics and vizualisation tools 

Concretely all of theses questions could be leveraged and organize via issues.
